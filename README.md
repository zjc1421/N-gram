# N-gram and BPE Implementation

This repository contains my custom implementation and approach for building N-gram models and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) from scratch. The project focuses on understanding and constructing these foundational techniques used in natural language processing.

## Features
- Implementation of N-gram models
- Construction of BPE from scratch
- Step-by-step approaches to tokenization and probability calculation

## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to showcase my understanding and application of basic NLP techniques without relying on pre-built libraries, reinforcing core concepts in language modeling and tokenization.

## Acknowledgment
This work was completed as part of the coursework for **Winter 2023, CSE 447: Natural Language Processing** (taught by Professor **Yejin Choi**) at the **University of Washington**. The owner of this repository is **Jingchuan Zhou**.

## How to Use
Clone the repository and follow the included scripts and examples to explore the implementations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/N-gram.git
